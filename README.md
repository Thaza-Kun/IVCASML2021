# HDBSCAN

```cmd
pip install hdbscan
```
If you have trouble installing HDBSCAN from pip, try installing the latest Desktop Development with C++ tools from [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and try again. Otherwise, consider using conda.

```cmd
conda install -c conda-forge hdbscan
```
